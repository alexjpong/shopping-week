We then see how developments in the 19th and 20th centuries destroy this view of time. In the 19th century, the distinction between past and future emerges from considerations of statistical processes. In the 20th century, the theory of relativity forces fundamental changes in the concept of time. Time ceases to be universal and becomes entangled with space and gravity. Quantum mechanics limits the predictability of the future and introduces verified effects so weird that Einstein wrote of them, \"No reasonable definition of reality could be expected to permit this.\"","prerequisites":"","notes":"\/\/ Some knowledge of secondary school physics useful, but not required.

This allows us to study both the historical contributions of Buddhism to the philosophies and self-cultivation traditions of Asia, and the new ways it serves as a global human heritage in the contemporary context.","prerequisites":"","notes":"Offered jointly with the Divinity School as 3830.

In Unit 3 we look at diverse forms-such as Jazz, Blues, spoken word, DJ, dance, and sports-in order to revise how we conventionally understand entertainment and art, authenticity and imitation, artistic freedom and tradition, and the pleasures of being a spectator.","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"Sever Hall","room":"111"},{"cat_num":"1498","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"LING","number":"101","title":"The Science of Language: An Introduction","faculty":"fb29930a9fef4d2f0d0142e07c3d8e13","description":"This course introduces components of study of language: phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics.

In this course, we will explore how these fictions and counter-fictions are reproduced and challenged in some of the most powerful, canonical works of drama, fiction and cinema by South African and African American authors and filmmakers.

To be sure, Americans' access to food and the quality of the food they consume vary widely. But food is generally available. Whether found in supermarkets, farmer's markets, convenience stores, or restaurants of every variety, there is an abundance of food and a surfeit of choices. How did this come to be? How did high-yield agriculture develop? How did processed foods find their way to store shelves? To illuminate these questions and more, we will examine the history, technology, and politics of agricultural production throughout the twentieth century. We will also consider contemporary food production practices and ethical dilemmas about how food is produced. Course readings will cover how food has been cultivated, manufactured, and distributed, as well as the human labor behind some of these production stages.","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"Science Center","room":"252"},{"cat_num":"4266","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"APPHY","number":"397","title":"Materials Science","faculty":"93a60891ae814df3ce94a03459f3d6fa","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"4266","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"APPHY","number":"397","title":"Materials Science","faculty":"93a60891ae814df3ce94a03459f3d6fa","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"42674","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"BIOPHYS","number":"323","title":"Transcriptional Regulatory Circuits and Neuronal Circuits in Visual Recognition","faculty":"2dce3bae5544ee094af4ccb4eaa6087f","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"42674","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"BIOPHYS","number":"323","title":"Transcriptional Regulatory Circuits and Neuronal Circuits in Visual Recognition","faculty":"2dce3bae5544ee094af4ccb4eaa6087f","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"4268","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"100","title":"Engineering Design Projects","faculty":"88eedfd7a7b7a1fdaeb94a08e4bb2be2","description":"Individual design projects, with multiple realistic constraints, selected to provide experience in the processes and practice of engineering design.

Attention will be devoted to the patterns of interaction between the Muslim World and the West because it is our assumption that these patterns contribute to influence ideological formations and modes of religious\/political mobilizations in the Muslim World. By the end of the eighteenth century, much of the Muslim World was in \"decline\" whereas European imperial powers, mainly France and Great Britain, were on the rise. The course will explore the response of Muslim societies and intellectuals to the rise of European prominence.

Moreover, changes in Earth's climate are raising sea level, changing precipitation patterns, and likely causing an increase in the occurrence of damaging storms, putting more of our increasing exposed global population at risk. In this course we develop an understanding of these natural hazards from an earth science perspective, and examine several case studies to assess their catastrophic impacts. Given our scientific understanding of these phenomena, we examine ways to assess and forecast future natural disasters, and to mitigate the adverse impacts to our societies. Sections will emphasize the use of GIS technology to measure the impacts of natural hazards.","prerequisites":"","notes":"This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Core area requirement for Science A.","meetings":"","building":"Science Center","room":" D"},{"cat_num":"6002","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"345","title":"Neural Control of Movement","faculty":"03ee02e91cf2c1e740fcc06902af4424","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"6002","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"ENG-SCI","number":"345","title":"Neural Control of Movement","faculty":"03ee02e91cf2c1e740fcc06902af4424","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"6003","term":"FALL","bracketed":false,"field":"APPHY","number":"371","title":"Biological Physics and Quantitative Biology","faculty":"c0f8eb98b54d512201eb1b5fa7b01fc9","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"6003","term":"SPRING","bracketed":false,"field":"APPHY","number":"371","title":"Biological Physics and Quantitative Biology","faculty":"c0f8eb98b54d512201eb1b5fa7b01fc9","description":"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"","room":""},{"cat_num":"60047","term":"FALL","bracketed":true,"field":"ANTHRO","number":"1815","title":"Empire, Nation, Diaspora: Asians in the U.S.","faculty":"0037454d068b85f7e2d5348b8d43309a","description":"The U.S. is commonly described as a multicultural society and Asian Americans as \"model minorities\" with strong group identities.

Various political, cultural, and social movements of the 1960's created an environment for the stories of soul, jazz, and funk produced in the 1970's, which in turn created the platform for our most treasured hip-hop albums (Illmatic, The BluePrint, The Chronic, College Dropout, The Minstrel Show). \"Diggers\" from around the world travel from country to country, from record shop to basement, in search of the original \"breaks\"","prerequisites":"","notes":"","meetings":"","building":"Mt.
